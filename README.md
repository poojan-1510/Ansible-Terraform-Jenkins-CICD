# Terraform & Ansible Jenkins Deployment

This repository contains Terraform and Ansible configurations to provision infrastructure and deploy Jenkins on Docker.

---

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed ([Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli))
- Ansible installed ([Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html))
- Access to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS)
- SSH access to provisioned instances

---

## Terraform Workflow

1. Navigate to Terraform directory:

```bash
cd terraform

terraform init

terraform validate

terraform fmt


terraform plan


terraform apply -auto-approve


terraform output

---
## Ansible Workflow
Navigate to Ansible directory:

cd ../ansible


Replace the existing IP in the inventory file with the one generated by Terraform.
Run the Ansible playbooks in order:

```bash

ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml
ansible-playbook install-docker.yml
ansible-playbook jenkins-docker.yml


Notes
Ensure SSH keys are configured for Ansible to connect to the instance. (in the inventory file)
Jenkins will be accessible at the server’s public IP, default port 8080.
If Terraform configuration changes, rerun terraform apply.
